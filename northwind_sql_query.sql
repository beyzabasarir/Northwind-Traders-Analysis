-- CASE 1: CUSTOMERS 

-- The Marketing Department requested an analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to better segment customers based on purchasing behaviors.
-- Recency: How recently each customer made a purchase.
-- Frequency: How often each customer makes purchases.
-- Monetary value: The total amount spent by each customer.
-- The RFM model was used to classify customers into segments such as "Top Customers," "High Value Customers," and "At-Risk Customers." This segmentation will enable the marketing team to target different customer groups.

-- 2. Customers Profile: Analysis of customer purchasing behavior.

-- The Customer Insights Team requested an analysis focused on understanding the ordering behavior of individual customers. The goals of this analysis were:
-- Determining the total number of orders placed by each customer.
-- Calculating the average order value and identifying trends in purchasing patterns.
-- Measuring the average discount percentage applied to each customer's orders.
-- Identifying the preferred product category for each customer based on the most frequently purchased category.

-- CASE 2: SALES 

-- The Sales Department requested an analysis to understand the impact of discounts on total sales revenue. The department wanted to evaluate:
-- The total sales generated with and without discounts.
-- The proportion of sales that occurred with discounts applied across various product categories.
-- The discount percentage for each product category and its contribution to overall revenue.
-- This analysis is relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of discount strategies.

-- 4. Sales Trend: Monthly analysis of customer purchasing trends.

-- The Sales Department needed a detailed analysis of monthly sales trends to track how sales quantities fluctuate over time for each customer. The objectives of this analysis included:
-- Breaking down the total quantity of products sold per customer on a monthly basis.
-- Identifying any seasonal trends or irregularities in customer purchasing behavior.

-- Monthly breakdown of sales quantities by customer

-- CASE 3: PRODUCTS 
-- The Product Management Team asked for an analysis of product profitability to better understand which products contribute the most to the companyâ€™s bottom line. They were interested in:
-- Total revenue generated by each product.
-- Associated freight costs: How shipping costs affect the profitability of each product.
-- Net profitability: The overall profit of each product after subtracting freight costs.
-- This analysis helps the team decide on product discontinuation, pricing strategies, and inventory prioritization.
